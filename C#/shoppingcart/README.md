# Overview

{This project is the practice C# software for me to learn more languages.}

{This program is a shopping list program that user can input what that want to buy and can save the shoping list as a text file.}

{I write this program is beacuse I always forgot what I need to buy while shopping, so I make this program so I can send the text file to my phone or print it out.}
